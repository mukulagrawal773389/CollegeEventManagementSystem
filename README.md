Introduction
1.1 Objective
The main objective of the Project on College Event orientation is to manage the 
details of College, Event, Student, Theme, Registration. It manages all the information 
about College, Services, Registration, College. The project is totally built a: 
administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access.
The purpose of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual 
work for managing the College, Event, Services, Student. It tracks all the details about 
the Student, Theme, Registration.
1.2 Scope
The "Event Orientation" has been developed to override the problems prevailing 
in the practicing manual system. This Website is supported to eliminate and, in some
cases, reduce the hardships faced by this existing system. Moreover, this system is 
designed for the particular need of the college to carry out operations in a smooth and 
effective manner.
The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the 
data. It also provides error message while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge 
is needed for the user to use this system. Thus, by this all it proves it is user-friendly. 
Event Orientation, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast

management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather 
to concentrate on the record keeping. Thus, it will help organization in better utilization 
of resources.
Every organization, whether big or small, has challenges to overcome and 
managing the information of Activity, Event, Attendees, Payment, Conductors. Every 
Event Management System has different Event needs. This is designed to assist in 
strategic planning, and will help you ensure that your organization is equipped with the 
right level of information and details for your future goals. our systems come with 
remote access features, which will allow you to participate anytime, at all times. These 
systems will ultimately allow you to better manage resources.
Our project aims at event process automation, i.e., we have tried to computerize various 
processes of Event Management System.
1.2.1 In computer system the person has to fill the various forms & number of 
copies of the forms can be easily generated at a time.
1.2.2 To utilize resources in an efficient manner by increasing their productivity 
through automation.
1.2.3 The system generates types of information that can be used for various 
purposes.
1.2.4 It satisfies the user requirement
1.2.5 Be easy to understand by the user and organizer of the event.
1.2.6 Have a good user interface

2. SYSTEM ANALYSIS
2.1 FEASIBILITY STUDY
A feasibility study is a high-level capsule version of the entire System analysis and Design 
Process. The study begins by classifying the problem definition. Feasibility is to determine 
if it’s worth doing. Once an acceptance problem definition has been generated, the analyst 
develops a logical model of the system. A search for alternatives is analysed carefully. 
There are 3 parts in feasibility study.
2.1.1 Operational Feasibility
Question that going to be asked are –
 Will the system be used if it developed and implemented? 
 If there was sufficient support for the project from the management and from the 
users.
 Have the users been involved in planning and development of the Project.
2.1.2 Technical feasibility
 Does the necessary technology exist to do what is been suggested?
 Does the proposed equipment have the technical capacity for using the new system?
 Are there technical guarantees of accuracy, reliability and data security?
 The project is developed on i5 with 16 GB RAM.
 The environment required in the development of system is any windows platform. 
 The observer pattern along with factory pattern will update the results eventually.
 The language used in the development is HTML, CSS, JSP, Wamp Server and 
database as MySQL.
2.1.3 Economical Feasibility
To decide whether a project is economically feasible, to consider various factors as cost 
benefit analysis, long-term returns and maintenance costs

3. Modules of College Event Orientation:
3.1 Registration Module: Used for managing the details ofRegistration.
Students of the College can register themselves on the event orientation 
website through this module.
3.2 Services Module Used for managing the details of Services.
If Someone whether he has an account or not can contact the admin for 
any queries related to the events, participation, technical problems etc.
And admin can see these messages and can reply to them through mail.
3.3 Event Management Module: Used for managing the information and 
details of the Event.
In the event management module admin can create and delete events. And 
manages all the participants in the event through the admin panel.
3.4 Student Module: Used for managing the student details Theme Module 
Used for managing the theme information.
This module gives students the facility to participate in on going events 
and see their result. If student has won any competition, they can also 
download their respective certificate.
3.5 Login Module. Used for managing the login details.
Using this module registered students can login into their respective 
accounts using their Email ID and Password.

4 System Design of Event Orientation System
In this phase, a logical system is built which fulfils the given requirements. Design 
phase of software development deals with transforming the clients 's requirements
into a logically working system. Normally, design is performed in the following in 
the following two steps:
 Primary Design Phase:
In this phase, the system is designed at block level. The blocks are created on the
basis of analysis done in the problem identification phase. Different blocks are 
created for different functions emphasis is put on minimizing the information 
flow between blocks. Thus, all activities which require more interaction are kept 
in one block.
 Secondary Design Phase:
In the secondary phase the detailed design of every block is performed.
The general tasks involved in the design process are the following:
4.1 Design various blocks for overall system processes.
4.2 Design smaller, compact and workable modules in each block.
4.3 Design various database structures.
4.4 Specify details of programs to achieve desired functionality.
4.5 Design the form of inputs, and outputs of the system
4.6 Perform documentation of the design.

5 Project Category
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS): This is an RDBMS based
project which is currently using MySQL for all the transaction statements. MySQL
is an open-source RDBMS System.
5.1 Brief Introduction about RDBSM:
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management
system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd,
of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Many popular databases currently in 
use are based on the relational databasemodel.
RDBMSS have become a predominant choice for the storage of information in new 
databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, 
personnel data, and much more since the 1980s. Relational databases have often 
replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they are 
easier to understand and use. However, relational databases have been challenged 
by object databases, which were introduced in an attempt to address the objectrelational impedance mismatch in relational database, and XML databases.

5.2 Implementation Methodology:
Model View Controller or MVC as it is popularly called, is a software design
pattern for developing web applications. A Model View Controller pattern is
made up of the following three parts:
Model- The lowest level of the pattern which isresponsible for
maintaining data. View - This is responsible for displaying all
or a portion of the data to the user.
Controller - Software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and 
View.
